# Echo Dump
### Disclaimer
All of this is just a few tools I've made for EVR that's actually sharable. Maybe I'll add more in the future. Any of the research in this is just a dump of notes/tools I used. It shouldn't be used for anything that can negatively impact the game. Use whatever you want, only thing I ask is to just @ me and show off what it is you made.

### Atlas
Source to Atlas with API urls stripped to protect the servers.

### .milk Replay
This is a recorder and compression tool for being able to store game replays in the smallest format that is still useful. The format would be ideal for any of you that are trying to build replay tools as the .milk files are super small and are built to allow for streaming of chunks meaning it's easy to jump around in playback without having to store the entire replay in memory. Typically yields a 94-98% reduction. A loose estimate is 1 minute at 60fps should be able to compress down to less than 1mb. There's a README inside that outlines the format specifications. 

### Stream Overlay
Source for the stream overlay I made for Pizza League and didn't finish for VRML. Has the improved minimap, scoreboard, and stats. Could definitely be improved on and it should be finished so it can be used.

### Echo Package Dumping Scripts
Really loose package of scripts I'd use to dump the package files for Echo. Never used any of the contents of the archive for anything but just did it as reverse engineering research. Figured I'd put out that stuff so you can get yourself high quality audio of the disc ding noise.
